                <p>To get started with Protobiota, go to the following link and download the corresponding zip file for
                    your operating system:</p>
                <a href="https://github.com/MylesScholz/A-Life-Capstone-Project/releases/tag/v1.0.0">
                    https://github.com/MylesScholz/A-Life-Capstone-Project/releases/tag/v1.0.0
                </a>
                <p>Unzip the contents of the file into the same directory on your computer. Then, simply
                    double-click the executable to launch Protobiota.</p>
                <p>The user interface is described in detail below, as well as some details about the underlying systems
                    of the simulation.</p>

            <div class="guide-content-frame" id="UserInterface">
                <h1>User Interface</h1>
                <h2>Main Menu</h2>
                <p>Protobiota opens on its main menu (pictured below). There are three buttons on this page: "Start
                    New Simulation", "Settings", and "Quit". "Start New Simulation" will create a new simulation and
                    take you to the main simulation view. "Settings" will open the settings menu without starting a new
                    simulation. Lastly, "Quit" will close Protobiota. This does not save your parameters or settings.
                </p>
                <img src="MainMenu.png" />
                <h2>Simulation View</h2>
                <p>The main simulation view shows the full environment in which cells are confined (pictured below).
                    There are two interface panels: the navbar at the top of the window and the statistics panel, which
                    is in the bottom right of the window by default.</p>
                <img src="SimulationView.png" />
                <p>The navbar has several controls for the simulation: the simulation title ("Protobiota"), "Menu",
                    "Reset", "Stats", and the speed controls. Clicking on the simulation title will take you to the main
                    menu. The "Menu" button opens and closes the settings menu while the simulation is ongoing. The
                    "Reset" button creates a new simulation with updated parameters. The "Stats" button opens and closes
                    the statistics panel. The speed controls allow you to pause, speed up, or slow down the simulation.
                    The left-facing double arrows reduce the simulation speed by half, and the right-facing double
                    arrows double the speed. The vertical bars pause the simulation, and while paused, the right-facing
                    triangle unpauses.</p>
                <p>The statistics panel shows information about cells and the environment as a whole. It has two tabs:
                    "Cell" and "Lineage". The "Cell" tab always shows the current number of living cells in the
                    environment and the total number of nutrient zones created since it began. You can click on a cell
                    directly to select it, and the "Cell" tab will display some of its internal state information, such
                    as its age, size, and available resources (pictured below). When you do this, the view will zoom in
                    on the selected cell and follow it as it moves. Keyboard shortcuts to toggle this tracking or clear
                    the selection entirely will also appear in the top left of the screen.</p>
                <img src="CellSelected.png" />
                <p>The "Lineage" tab displays the relationships between cells, living and dead, in the current
                    simulation. By default, it selects the "last universal common ancestor" (LUCA), which is the
                    theoretical organism from which all life originates. You can select related cells by clicking the
                    blue circles in the "Parents" and "Children" sections of this tab or by clicking living cells
                    directly. Doing either will also select the cell in the "Cell" tab. Dead cells will appear in
                    an inset when selected. The following images show the "Lineage" tab when LUCA is selected and when a
                    dead cell is selected, respectively.</p>

                    <img src="LUCASelected.png" />
                    <img src="DeadCellSelected.png" />
                </div>
                <h2>Settings Menu</h2>
                <p>You can open the settings menu either from the main menu (pictured below) or from the simulation
                    view. It has a "Quit to Menu" button in the bottom left that closes the current simulation (if there
                    is one) and returns you to the main menu. If the menu is open from the simulation view, the X button
                    in the top right will simply close the settings menu without ending the simulation.</p>
                <p>In its main area, the settings menu has three tabs: "General", "Keybindings", and "Parameters". You
                    can set some preferences for the user interface through the settings in the "General" tab. The
                    "Keybindings" tab shows a list of keyboard mappings for various simulation and UI controls. Finally,
                    the "Parameters" tab allows you to set some of the values on which the simulation is based, such as
                    the number of initial cells and nutrient zones. See the Parameters section below for more details.

                <h1>Cell Structures</h1>
                <p>A distinguishing feature of Protobiota is the system of cell structures and their interactions that
                    define cell behavior. Cells are entirely composed of five types of structures: cell membranes,
                    flagella, nuclei, mitochondria, and ribosomes. The presence of each cell structure and their
                    behavior is determined by the cell's genome, and each structure acts independently of the others.
                    For details about the Genome, see the Genome section below.
