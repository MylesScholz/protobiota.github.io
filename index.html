                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Protobiota is an artificial life (A-life) simulation—software that replicates the
                        structures
                        and
                        processes of organisms
                        and simulates them in a virtual environment. Our project focuses on protozoa-like
                        single-cellular organisms, and we
                        sought to demonstrate large-scale phenomena such as evolution and speciation.​</p>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;In our simulation each cell has various substructures, such as nuclei and
                        mitochondria,
                        that
                        operate by very simple
                        rules. We can, however, observe more complex behaviors emerging from these basic processes. For
                        example, the cells
                        exhibit homeostasis (maintaining internal equilibrium), chemotaxis (food-seeking), and
                        metabolism (digesting nutrients).
                        We show that these organisms can adapt to internal and external pressures through natural
                        selection and develop
                        self-sustaining processes.</p>

                        &emsp;&emsp;Protobiota is unique in that it is has more detail and complex behaviors than
                        many other A-life simulations. It is also a simulation of artificial life that is designed to
                        be easy to use and understand, with a more simple and intuitive interface. It has more detailed
                        graphics than many other A-life simulations that are specifically designed to tell the user exactly
                        what is happening with each cell. All this makes it more engaging and ideal for educational purposes,
                        as it can be used to teach complex biological concepts in a way that is engaging and interactive
                        without requiring indepth prior knowledge.

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Godot is an open-source game engine that we used as a framework for Protobiota. It
                        handles much of the rendering, UI, and physics behavior of the simulation. Additionally, we used
                        GDExtension--an interface of Godot that allowed us to write custom nodes in C++.</p>
